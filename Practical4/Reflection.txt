In Practical 4, not everything went well as I expected.
Today's practical is more challenging than any other practicals we did before.
What I was confused most about was that when I did according to the instructions, there was always something different between the expected results that was given and the results I got.
I speculated that it was because I did something wrong but I did not aware, or there were differences between different systems.
