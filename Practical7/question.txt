Plot a boxplot of total case numbers in different countries on 31 March 2020.
Line number: 74 - 89
Discussion:
The median is closer to Q1 than to Q3.
From the boxplot, we can tell that there is a great degree of data volatility, which means there is a great degree of data volatility in total case numbers in different countries on 31 March 2020.
There are outliers in the data.
However, in order to make the graph more clear to see, I do not show the outliers.
It means there is a country whose total case number on 31 March 2020 is greatly different from other countries.
